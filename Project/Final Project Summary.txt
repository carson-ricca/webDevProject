Final Project Summary
* My site has a two-column layout with a sidebar and the main section of the webpage being utilized for the search results, product information, and contact us form on their respective pages. My website has a header that contains a link to the home page and to the contact us page. My website also has a footer that contains fake copyright and addressing information for the company.
* My site has a fully-functional responsive design that was implemented using bootstrap flex grids. All information on all pages will resize to whatever the window size is of the device using it. On a mobile device, the navbar will collapse to have a menu button that allows the user to use the home and contact us links without cluttering their screen. 
* My site has fully functioning search capability with the requirements outlined in the project description. The search input bar works by searching for titles that are ‘like’ what the user inputs, searching for categories ‘like’ the user input, and searching for authors ‘like’ the user input. All books are stored in the database and the search searches for the user input in the database in real-time. 
* The search results are updated using AJAX so the main page never has to be reloaded to display the results of the user’s search. It will continue to update dynamically with the user’s input. I also clear the search bar after every search so the user can continue to type their searches without a need to click and delete their old search.
* The search results display the book title, author, book image, and a short description. The title has a hyperlink that redirects the user to the product page specific for that book. The author’s name has a hyperlink that updates the search results to show all books the author wrote without refreshing the page.
* The ‘more’ link at the end of the description also leads the user to the product page for the specific book.
* The product page has the product details, the larger book image, and the author’s name as a hyperlink which redirects the user to index.php and searches for all book’s by the author using the preexisting search methods.
* The sidebar has the search input field that utilizes the general search through AJAX. It also has links for the book categories that filter the search with AJAX for all books that are in that category. The bottom of the search bar also has a clock that is asynchronously updated from the database time. 
*  The contact us form has required fields that must be filled in order for the form to submit. The form has validation using JavaScript for the required fields. First, all fields must be filled in order for the form to submit. First and last name fields must only contain letters. The phone number field must contain only numbers. The email field must contain ‘@’ and ‘.’ for the email to be valid. The message field must be filled for the form to submit. If any of the fields are invalid the form will not submit and the fields will turn red with text saying which field is invalid.
* When the form is successfully submitted an AJAX call is sent to processContact.php, which takes the information entered into the form and updates the contact page with a thank you message, the user’s message, and the contact information the user entered. Upon submission the forms input fields also clear.
* The header appears on all pages. It contains the site logo as an ‘SVG’, the site title, and navigation links for the main page, and the contact page. All of these are contained within a navbar that collapses on page resize. Clicking the site logo, title, or home link will all redirect the user to the main page and displays all books stored in the database.
* I added a book count beside the category link that displays the total number of books in that category. The number is updated directly from the database; if any books are added to the database the count will update respectively. 
* All styling was done with a combination of bootstrap and CSS.
