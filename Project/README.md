# COSC 264 Project
# Due Dates: 

All code must be committed by the end of the day on April 13th, 2020

# Overview:

The project is designed to help develop your skills for full stack development.  With this project, you will build a bookstore website that is able to display content from the web site.  The front-end will be required to be responsive (mobile).  The backend will be developed in PHP.  This is an individual project.   You are encouraged to use code that you have developed in the labs to complete this activity (as most of the functionality required in this project, has already been competed in a lab activity and just needs to be repurposed/modified).   Start with building the logic of the site to ensure that it is working and then move onto styling.    Additionally, this will help you in preparation for your final exam.

#Getting Started:

Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation and checkout the repository to your local machine.  Remember to commit your work frequently and to push your code upstream by the due date.  

# Hardware and Software:

You will develop the project using Linux, MySQL, Apache and PHP in addition to CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript/JQuery on the client-side.  The backend must be completed with PHP.  You will need to use XAMPP on your local machine for PHP.  The database is hosted for you on COSC499.ok.ubc.ca.  Your project will be stored in the class provided repository.  You do not need to deploy your web site, but your repository will be required to be cloned and run without any changes.  All source code must be available for review.  You are required to keep your code under version control with GIT.  Database access will be provided for you and you will be able read data from the project database.   When you checkout the project, please note the locations of files in the repository.  You must use relative referencing so that when your site is deployed and marked, it will work.

The majority of the framework of this project can be (should be) built with the code you have put together across various labs.  You are free to re-use/repurpose code samples from class and labs.  The goal with the project is to practice the skills required to put together a simple dynamic website.   If you repurpose code from an external source, please appropriately attribute your sources.  For example, if you use a code snippet from stack overflow, correctly attribute in your code.  

You will use an existing database that has read only privileges on cosc499.ok.ubc.ca.  The database is named db_project and the connection information is:

Username: WebUser

Password: 9UcM0QQcK1BwAXLk

At the end of the project, you will have a website that you can use as a portfolio piece to demonstrate your skills.  This site has a limited number of pages but demonstrated the power of dynamic content generation and code re-use.   I think that at the end of the project you will be surprised how little code is required to accomplish the takes for this site. 

Please see COSC 264 Project Details.pdf (in the project repo) for details of reqiurement for the project.
